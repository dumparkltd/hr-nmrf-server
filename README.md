## Documentation

This README describes the purpose of this repository and how to set up a development environment. Other sources of documentation are as follows:

* UI and API designs are in `doc/`
* Server setup instructions are in `PROVISIONING.md`
* Staging and production deployment instructions are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## API documentation

API documentation is available in the `doc/` folder in Swagger format. Documentation can either be viewed locally using [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui), or via the [online editor tool](editor.swagger.io). Using the editor tools, API
clients in several languages can be generated.

## Prerequisites

This project requires:

* Ruby 2.3.1, preferably managed using [rbenv][]
* PhantomJS (in order to use the [poltergeist][] gem)
* PostgreSQL must be installed and accepting connections

On a Mac, you can obtain all of the above packages using [Homebrew][]. If you wish to use Docker, the above dependencies will be provided by the Dockerfile and docker-compose file included in this repository.

If you need help setting up a Ruby development environment, check out this [Rails OS X Setup Guide](https://mattbrictson.com/rails-osx-setup-guide).

## Code style

This project uses overcommit to enforce code style. To enable overcommit locally

`
gem install overcommit
overcommit -i
`

You'll need to sign the overcommit (verify you're happy with it executing).
Do this after installing, and again every time the overcommit config changes.

```
overcommit --sign
```

To install the extra linters, run
```
[sudo] pip install yamllint
npm install -g jshint
```

## Getting started


#### With Docker

Run `docker-compose up` to create and start a DB and app image, with the app listening on port 3000. You will also need to run `docker-compose run app rake db:setup to create and seed a development database. The app has several configuration value that can be set that are listed in the `example.env` file. You can either copy this file to `.env` and provide your own configuration, or explicitly pass in your configuration to the `docker run` command.

If you already have a database instance and just wish to run the app you will need to build the image:

`docker build . -t "undp-human-rights-national-reporting"`

And then run the resulting image:

`docker run undp-human-rights-national-reporting -P -e PGHOST=YOUR_DB_HOST -e PGUSER=YOUR_PG_USER`

#### Without Docker

Run the `bin/setup` script. This script will:

* Check you have the required Ruby version
* Install gems using Bundler
* Create local copies of `.env` and `database.yml`
* Create, migrate, and seed the database

##### Run it!

1. Run `rake spec` to make sure everything works.
2. Run `rails s` to start the Rails app.
